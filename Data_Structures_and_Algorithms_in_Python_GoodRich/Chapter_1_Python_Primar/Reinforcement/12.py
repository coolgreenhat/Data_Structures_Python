"""
Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function choice(data) that returns a random element from a non-empty sequence.
The random module includes a more basic function randrange, with parameterization similar to the built-in range function,
that return a random choice from the given range. Using only the randrange function, implement your own version of the choice function.
